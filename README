This is sysfs-based GPIO monitor.

Useful for old kernels, where only sysfs user interface for GPIO supported.
(See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gpio/sysfs.txt)
Although sysfs interface for GPIO is deprecated in newer kernels, it is
still present.

Features:
 - plain C, no dependencies, easy cross compile — suitable for small embedded devices
 - sysfs-based — suitable for very old boards with linux kernel 2.4/2.6
 - simple configuration file to define monitored gpio numbers and desired actions
 - actions: execute OS command or sending messages via unix domain sockets

TODO:
 - new action type for sending messages via unix domain socket

Compile:
  Just run 'make' in project directory. Executable will be in ./build directory.

Cross-compile:
  Modify 'make-cross.sh' according to your toolschain. Run './make-cross.sh' in
  project directory.

Usage:
   Modify gpio-monitor.conf according to your needs and put it in /etc directory
   or use --config option to specify gpio-monitor.conf location.
